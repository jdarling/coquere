Gluten-Free Double Chocolate Cookies

These are probably the best gluten-free cookies I've ever made. Not chalky, but
chewy. I haven't tried making these egg-free, but that might work. I make a
flour mix for baking that is quarter each of rice, sorghum, tapioca, and
chestnut flours, with a pinch of xanthan gum, then use it in place of flour.
Sifting or whisking helps. I dusted with confectioners' sugar. Looks nice with
the dark chocolate.

This is another line in the description.

Ingredients

1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/4 cup rice flour
1/4 cup tapioca flour
1/4 cup sorghum flour
1/4 cup chestnut flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
4 ounces chocolate chips
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon gluten-free vanilla extract
2 eggs
4 ounces chocolate chips

Directions

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with
parchment paper or a silicon baking mat.

Mix white sugar, cocoa powder, rice flour, tapioca flour, sorghum flour,
chestnut flour, baking soda, salt, and xanthan gum together in a large bowl.

Melt 4 ounces chocolate chips, with butter and vanilla extract in the top of a
double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the
sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Remove from heat.

Stir eggs into the flour mixture; slowly pour melted chocolate mixture into
flour mixture. Stir until incorporated. Fold 4 ounces chocolate chips into the
batter.

Drop batter roughly in a ball shape, 1 tablespoon per cookie, onto the prepared
baking sheet, keeping balls 2 inches apart.

Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are spread and top surface is slightly
cracked, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on the pan for 10 minutes before removing to
cool completely on a wire rack to allow cookies to set.
