  <p>Coquere is Latin for "to cook", and Coquere is meant to be a website for
    keeping your recipes handy.  It is very much a work in progress.</p>
  <p>This is the demo instance of Coquere.  You can browse recipes and looks at
    the screens for update and create.  You can not actually update or create
    a recipe without an account.  For now account signup is by invitation only.
    All functionality with the exception of actually saving changes works for
    guest (unauthorized) accounts.</p>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>There really are not any good open source recipe management systems on the
    web today. There are a few out there, but they are dated, ugly, hard to work
    with, or I simply didn't like them.</p>
  <p>I wanted to learn React, and needed a place to put my families recipes so
    we could all get to them. So figured I'd build something and learn something
    at the same time.</p>
